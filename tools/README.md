# Tools

Simple tools that help with the refectoring to match the current code layout. These might be usefull they might not.

Currently refactor.py takes all of the images, and sorts them into their correct folders, as well as creating those folder, incase anyone created one using the old method, and would like to refactor them.

The recode.py, SHOULD fix the layout of your renderer.js so that the existing image directories now point to the new refactored method.

Simply put either in the directory where your index.html is located, and let them rip. Minus a weird issue with single character names, I.E. the PS5 Controllers track pad, which I'd just named T, everything should update automatically to match the refactor.
