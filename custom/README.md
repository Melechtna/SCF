# Custom Controllers

While the repo is primarily designed for "official products", this folder will be for more common cusomisations, and possibly even some more unique variations depending on the context of the push request. This could be something like, a commonly printed shell replacement, button replacements, modified layouts, etc. Ultimately this framework is meant for "stock" devices, I see no reason we couldn't add in some of the more common modifications here if the demand is high enough.
